    <h2>Research and Information Gathering</h2>
    
    <h3>Mind Mapping</h3>
    <p>For the mind mapping exercise, I explored key concepts such as secure coding practices, encryption, authentication, and more. The interconnected ideas provide a visual representation of the complex landscape of web application security.</p>

    <h3>Web App Security Architecture</h3>
    <p>I delved into the intricacies of web application security architecture, understanding the roles of components like firewalls, secure coding frameworks, and secure communication protocols.</p>

    <h3>Article Review</h3>
    <p>I reviewed two articles that significantly contributed to my understanding of web application security. The reviews highlight key findings and their implications for practical security implementations.</p>

    <h3>Implementation Examples</h3>
    <p>In this section, I present practical examples of implementing web application security measures. Code snippets and diagrams illustrate the application of security concepts in real-world scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Creating User Awareness</h3>
    <p>Proposing strategies to create user awareness of web application security threats is crucial. I discuss effective ways to educate users about potential risks and promote secure online behaviors.</p>
</section><section id="ethics">
    <h2>Research Ethics</h2>
    
    <h3>Challenges in the Research Process</h3>
    <p>While conducting research on web and application security, I encountered challenges in navigating complex technical topics. Ethical considerations were paramount, and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of information posed its own set of challenges.</p>

    <h3>Lessons Learned in the Research Process</h3>
    <p>The research process taught me the importance of thorough investigation, critical analysis, and ethical sourcing. It enhanced my ability to discern credible information from unreliable sources.</p>

    <h3>Steps to Prevent Plagiarism</h3>
    <p>To prevent plagiarism, I follow a systematic approach:
        <ol>
            <li>Clearly identify and attribute sources in my research.</li>
            <li>Adhere to proper citation styles recommended in my course guidelines.</li>
            <li>Summarize and paraphrase information instead of direct copying.</li>
        </ol>
